			Hi,<br/>
			<br/>
			The year 2019 was really intense for me.
			I contributed to various open source projects and gained a lot of experience.
			For example, I contributed to the <a href="http://archiva.apache.org">Apache Archiva</a> project,
			the <a href="https://moquette-io.github.io/moquette/">Moquette</a> project and
			to <a href="https://www.sempervideo.de">SemperVideo</a>s project called
			<a href="https://github.com/RPiList/specials">RPiList/specials</a>. Some changes were only
			minor (especially the one for Moquette).<br/>
			<br/>
			I also started a new project called <a href="https://github.com/joestr/PluGet">PluGet</a>.
			Basically said it is a Bukkit/BungeeCord plugin with the ability to install other plugins like with
			<code>apt install &lt;package name&gt;</code>.<br/>
			<br/>
			Also my other projects like <a href="https://github.com/joestr/ZoneMenu">ZoneMenu </a>(Spigot Plugin),
			<a href="https://github.com/joestr/DBWrapper">DBWrapper </a>and <a href="https://github.com/joestr/crtfnd">crtfind</a> 
			will receive updates.<br/>
			<br/>
			Right now I'm in my final school year and I'm really busy at the moment but I will try to do as much as possible.<br/>
			<br/>
			Enjoy the last moments of 2019 and see you in 2020 again!<br/>
			<br/>
			Joel
