			Hi,<br/>
			<br/>
			2020 has finally come to an end!<br/>
			<br/>
			It was a really rough year for some folks. Espacially for people working in the health sector.<br/>
			<br/>
			My year started of with announcing a restructuring process of my current infrastructure.<br/>
			This took rather long to complete compared to other projects I have done but I re-organised<br/>
			my servers (and my home infrastructure) one-by-one.<br/>
			<br/>
			During this time I also gruated from the <a href="https://www.htl-villach.at/">Higher Technical College in Villach</a>.<br/>
			Despite the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic the last semester went on as normal as it would be for 2020.<br/>
			<br/>
			After graduating I had some spare time (obviously :D) to finishing the seamless ernourmous task of re-organising<br/>
			the servers and all the services linked with them.<br/>
			<br/>
			Later this year I dropped Drupal in favour of this website. I simply do not have the nerves and time for a<br/>
			full-blown blog software since I only post one, two or three times a year.<br/>
			<br/>
			In September my so-called <i>Pr&auml;senzdienst</i> started and I choosed to work at the <a href="https://www.roteskreuz.at/">Austrian Red Cross</a>.<br/>
			After I failed my medic certification the first time I nailed it one week later. The medic certification lasts for two years.<br/>
			<br/>
			2020 was a year with many ups and downs and I hope 2021 will run smoothly, despite the fact that I hurt my knee badly yesterday. :(<br/>
			<br/>
			Have a great year! :)
			<br/>
			Joel
