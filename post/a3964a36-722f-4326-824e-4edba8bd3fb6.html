			Greetings,<br/>
            <br/>
            Solving an unforeseen problem is especially nerve-wracking if you work on your gate to the internet (kind of).<br/>
            <br/>
            On my weekly SSH round-trip to my servers, where I update system and software (mostly guided, I only intervene on errors)<br/>
            I updated my self-hosted <a href="https://www.bitwarden.com">Bitwarden</a> instance. this is where the problem begins.<br/>
            <br>
            Unknowingly at this point, I successfully set my be-loved password manager offline due to an oversight from my side.<br/>
			<br/>
            So the days pass and nothing happens. I can still log-on to websites, my <abbr title="Time-based One-Time Password">TOTP</abbr>s work just fine.<br/>
			<br/>
            Today I noticed that I cannot log on to my Bitwarden server on a new device. Weird.<br/>
			<br/>
            The browser extension seemed fine so I suspected it was server and yeah, a beautiful <code>502 Bad Gateway</code>, but<br/>
            the error was coming from the nginx provided by Bitwarden, since I use an Apache HTTP daemon for proxying, so on to fixing the error.<br/>
			<br/>
            Maybe a Bitwarden update would help? No.<br/>
			<br/>
            System update? Try again.<br/>
			<br/>
            Ok. Let's ask the mighty problem solver ... Google.<br/>
            (Fast-forward an hour: nothing described my situation.)<br/>
			<br/>
            Fine, time to list docker processes with <code>docker ps</code>. And there you find the culprit some containers were in an unhealthy.<br/>
            After consulting the Bitwarden manual I verified that at least the mssql container was fine.<br/>
            Shortly after, I nailed down the culprit to be the admin container not connecting to the mssql server.<br/>
			<br/>
            After another system update and a reboot, the problem persisted.<br/>
			<br/>
            On to the manual again.<br/>
			<br/>
            And then there it was. Docker.<br/>
            Turns out the Docker installation was <i>slightly</i> out of date (if you agree that one major version is <i>slightly</i>)<br/>
			<br/>
            So installing the newest Docker version from the Docker repo directly (not Debian), rebuilding Bitwarden and my<br/>
            sacred blue angel came back to life.<br/>
			<br/>
            Lessons learned:
            <ul>
                <li>Now your tech stack (<em>I thought I had the latest Docker version installed</em>)</li>
                <li>Read the fucking manual (<em>for real</em>)</li>
                <li>For the love of god, please use Ubuntu on your server (<em>if you are not insane, if you are, then welcome on board!</em>)</li>
            </ul>
			<br/>
            Joel
