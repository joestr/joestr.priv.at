		<h3 id="datenschutz-en">Privacy Policy</h3>
		<p>
			We created this Privacy Policy (version 01.01.1970-121377162),
			to declare which information we collect, how we use data and which options the users
			of our website have, according to the guidelines of the
			<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679&amp;%3Btid= 121377162">General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, these subjects sound rather technical due to their nature,
			but we have put much effort into describing the most important things as simply and clearly as possible.
		</p>
		<h3 id="automatische-datenspeicherung-en">Automatic Data Retention</h3>
		<p>
			Every time you visit a website nowadays, certain information is automatically
			created and saved, just as it happens on this website.
		</p>
		<p>
			Whenever you visit our website such as you are doing right now, our
			webserver (computer on which this website is saved/stored) automatically saves data such as
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the address (URL) of the accessed website</li>
			<li>browser and browser version</li>
			<li>the used operating system</li>
			<li>the address (URL) of the previously visited site (referrer URL)</li>
			<li>the host name and the IP-address of the device the website is accessed from</li>
			<li>date and time</li>
		</ul>
		<p>in files (webserver-logfiles).</p>

		<p>Generally, webserver-logfiles stay saved for two weeks and then get deleted automatically. We do not pass this information to others, but we cannot exclude the possibility that this data will be looked at in case of illegal conduct.</p>

		<h3 id="cookies-en">Cookies</h3>

		<h3>Our website uses HTTP-cookies to store user-specific data.<br />
		For your better understanding of the following Privacy Policy statement, we will explain to you below what cookies are and why they are in use.</h3>

		<h3>What exactly are cookies?</h3>

		<p>Every time you surf the internet, you use a browser. Common browsers are for example Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Most websites store small text-files in your browser. These files are called cookies.</p>

		<p>What should not be dismissed, is that cookies are very useful little helpers. Nearly all websites use cookies. More accurately speaking these are HTTP-cookies, since there are also different cookies for other uses. http-cookies are small files which our website stores on your computer. These cookie files are automatically put into the cookie-folder, which is like the “brain” of your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a value. Moreover, to define a cookie, one or multiple attributes must be specified.</p>

		<p>Cookies save certain parts of your user data, such as e.g. language or personal page settings. When you re-open our website, your browser submits these “user specific” information back to our site. Thanks to cookies, our website knows who you are and offers you the settings you are familiar to. In some browsers every cookie has its own file, in others such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in one single file.</p>

		<p>There are both first-party cookies and third-party coookies. First-party cookies are created directly by our site, while third-party cookies are created by partner-websites (e.g. Google Analytics). Every cookie is individual, since every cookie stores different data. The expiration time of a cookie also varies – it can be a few minutes, or up to a few years. Cookies are no software-programs and contain no computer viruses, trojans or any other malware. Cookies also cannot access your PC’s information.</p>

		<p>This is an example of how cookie-files can look:</p>

		<p><strong>name:</strong> _ga<br />
		<strong>value:</strong> GA1.2.1326744211.152121377162-9<br />
		<strong>purpose:</strong> differentiation between website visitors<br />
		<strong>expiration date:</strong> after 2 years</p>

		<p>A browser should support these minimum sizes:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>at least 4096 bytes per cookie</li>
			<li>at least 50 cookies per domain</li>
			<li>at least 3000 cookies in total</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Which types of cookies are there?</h3>

		<p>What exact cookies we use, depends on the used services. We will explain this in the following sections of the Privacy Policy statement. Firstly, we will briefly focus on the different types of HTTP-cookies.</p>

		<p>There are 4 different types of cookies:</p>

		<p><strong>Essential Cookies</strong><br />
		These cookies are necessary to ensure the basic function of a website. They are needed when a user for example puts a product into their shopping cart, then continues surfing on different websites and comes back later in order to proceed to the checkout. Even when the user closed their window priorly, these cookies ensure that the shopping cart does not get deleted.</p>

		<p><strong>Purposive Cookies</strong><br />
		These cookies collect info about the user behaviour and record if the user potentially receives any error messages. Furthermore, these cookies record the website’s loading time as well as its behaviour within different browsers.</p>

		<p><strong>Target-orientated Cookies</strong><br />
		These cookies care for an improved user-friendliness. Thus, information such as previously entered locations, fonts or data in forms stay saved.</p>

		<p><strong>Advertising Cookies</strong><br />
		These cookies are also known as targeting-Cookies. They serve the purpose of delivering individually adapted advertisements to the user. This can be very practical, but also rather annoying.</p>

		<p>Upon your first visit to a website you are usually asked which of these cookie-types you want to accept. Furthermore, this decision will of course also be saved in a cookie.</p>

		<h3>How can I delete cookies?</h3>

		<p>You yourself take the decision if and how you want to use cookies. Thus, no matter what service or website cookies are from, you always have the option to delete, deactivate or only partially allow them. Therefore, you can for example block cookies of third parties but allow any other cookies.</p>

		<p>If you want change or delete cookie-settings and would like to determine which cookies have been saved to your browser, you can find this info in your browser-settings:</p>

		<p><a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?tid=121377162">Chrome: Clear, enable and manage cookies in Chrome </a></p>

		<p><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac?tid=121377162">Safari: Manage cookies and website data in Safari </a></p>

		<p><a href="//support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox?tid=121377162">Firefox: Clear cookies and site data in Firefox </a></p>

		<p><a href="//support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies?tid=121377162">Internet Explorer: Delete and manage cookies </a></p>

		<p><a href="//support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4027947/microsoft-edge-delete-cookies?tid=121377162">Microsoft Edge: Delete cookies in Microsoft Edge </a></p>

		<p>If you generally do not want to allow any cookies at all, you can set up your browser in a way, to notify you whenever a potential cookie is about to be set. This gives you the opportunity to manually decide to either permit or deny the placement of every single cookie. The settings for this differ from browser to browser. Therefore, it might be best for you to search for the instructions in Google. If you are using Chrome, you could for example put the search phrase “delete cookies Chrome” or “deactivate cookies Chrome” into Google.</p>

		<h3>How is my data protected?</h3>

		<p>There is a “cookie policy” that has been in place since 2009. It states that the storage of cookies requires the user’s consent. However, among the countries of the EU, these guidelines are often met with mixed reactions. In Austria the guidelines have been implemented in § 96 section 3 of the Telecommunications Act (TKG).</p>

		<p>If you want to learn more about cookies and do not mind technical documentation, we recommend <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265</a>, the Request for Comments of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) called “HTTP State Management Mechanism”.</p>

		<h3 id="speicherung-persoenlicher-daten-en">Storage of Personal Data</h3>

		<p>Any personal data you electronically submit to us on this website, such as your name, email address, home address or other personal information you provide via the transmission of a form or via any comments to the blog, are solely used for the specified purpose and get stored securely along with the respective submission times and IP-address. These data do not get passed on to third parties.</p>

		<p>Therefore, we use personal data for the communication with only those users, who have explicitly requested being contacted, as well as for the execution of the services and products offered on this website. We do not pass your personal data to others without your approval, but we cannot exclude the possibility this data will be looked at in case of illegal conduct.</p>

		<p>If you send us personal data via email – and thus not via this website – we cannot guarantee any safe transmission or protection of your data. We recommend you, to never send confidential data via email.</p>

		<h2 id="rechte-dsgvo-en">Rights in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation</h2>

		<p>You are granted the following rights in accordance with the provisions of the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> (General Data Protection Regulation) and the Austrian <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Erv/ERV_1999_1_165/ERV_1999_1_165.html">Data Protection Act (DSG)</a>:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>right to rectification (article 16 GDPR)</li>
			<li>right to erasure (“right to be forgotten“) (article 17 GDPR)</li>
			<li>right to restrict processing (article 18 GDPR)</li>
			<li>righ to notification – notification obligation regarding rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing (article 19 GDPR)</li>
			<li>right to data portability (article 20 GDPR)</li>
			<li>Right to object (article 21 GDPR)</li>
			<li>right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing – including profiling – (article 22 GDPR)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>If you think that the processing of your data violates the data protection law, or that your data protection rights have been infringed in any other way, you can lodge a complaint with your respective regulatory authority. For Austria this is the data protection authority, whose website you can access at <a href="https://www.data-protection-authority.gv.at/?tid=121377162">https://www.data-protection-authority.gv.at/</a>.</p>

		<h3 id="auswertung-des-besucherverhaltens-en">Evaluation of Visitor Behaviour</h3>

		<p>In the following Privacy Policy, we will inform you on if and how we evaluate the data of your visit to this website. The evaluation is generally made anonymously, and we cannot link to you personally based on your behaviour on this website.</p>

		<p>You can find out more about how to disagree with the evaluation of visitor data, in the Privacy Policy below.</p>

		<h3 id="tls-verschluesselung-https-en">TLS encryption with https</h3>

		<p>We use https to transfer information on the internet in a tap-proof manner (data protection through technology design <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN&amp;tid=121377162">Article 25 Section 1 GDPR</a>). With the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security), which is an encryption protocol for safe data transfer on the internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential information. You can recognise the use of this safeguarding tool by the little lock-symbol, which is situated in your browser’s top left corner, as well as by the use of the letters https (instead of http) as a part of our web address.</p>
